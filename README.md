##FullThrottleAlchemistNEI

This is an add-on mod for FullThrottle Alchemist by bluedart.

It primarily adds NEI support for alchemy flasks and research vellums.

The mod also adds support for adding elements to items (including from other mods), adding your own atelier recipes, grinding recipes and freezing recipes via a json config file. The format is explained in this post on the FullThrottle Alchemist forum.
